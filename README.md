The objective of this project is to predict Coca-Cola product sales using historical sales data and machine learning techniques to support demand forecasting and business decision-making.

Data Collection & Understanding
The dataset includes sales data across regions, products, and time periods, along with factors such as pricing, promotions, seasonality, and distribution channels.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data analysis is conducted to identify sales trends, seasonal patterns, regional performance, and the impact of promotions and pricing on product demand.

Data Preprocessing

Missing and inconsistent values are handled.

Date features (month, quarter, year) are extracted.

Categorical variables such as region and product type are encoded.

Numerical features are scaled where required.

Feature Engineering & Selection
Important features such as promotional flags, temperature/season indicators, and historical sales lags are created to improve prediction accuracy.

Model Building
Regression and time-series models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or ARIMA are trained to forecast future sales volumes.

Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using performance metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared to ensure reliable sales predictions.

Sales Forecasting
The final model predicts future Coca-Cola sales across regions and product categories, enabling better production and supply chain planning.

Conclusion
This project helps optimize inventory, reduce stock-outs, and improve promotional strategies through accurate sales forecasting.
